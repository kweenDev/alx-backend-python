## Project Overview

The **alx-backend-python** repository covers essential Python skills for backend development, from fundamental type hints to advanced asynchronous operations. Through a collection of tasks and projects, you will learn how to create efficient, scalable, and clean backend code that follows best practices.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the projects in this repository, you will gain:

- Proficiency in Python's type annotations to enhance code readability and bug detection.
- The ability to build asynchronous applications using Python’s `async` and `await` syntax.
- Expertise in API development and integration.
- Familiarity with backend frameworks, performance optimization, and testing techniques.
- Advanced Python programming concepts and practices.

## Project List

Below are the projects contained in this repository, each focusing on different aspects of backend development:

### 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

- **Focus**: Introduction to Python's type annotations.
- **Key Concepts**: Variable annotations, function annotations, typing module, duck typing.

## Installation

To get started with the projects in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kweendev/alx-backend-python.git
```

Navigate to a specific project directory to work on a particular project, for example:

```bash
cd alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations
```

## Usage

Each project contains Python scripts that can be executed individually. Instructions for running the code are included in each project’s directory. For instance:

    1. **To execute a Python script**:
    ```bash
    python3 0-main.py
    ```
    2. **To run tests**: If the project includes unit tests, you can run them with:
    ```bash
    python3 -m unittest discover
    ```

Some projects may require additional dependencies such as `asyncio` or `redis-py`. Install any necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.7 or later.
- **OS**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later.
- **Code Style**: All Python code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guide. You can check code style using `pycodestyle`.

Install `pycodestyle` using:

```bash
pip install pycodestyle
```

Check code style using:

```bash
pycodestyle <filename.py>
```
